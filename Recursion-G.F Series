Siddhant made a special series and named it as G.F Series. The series follows this trend  Tn=(Tn-2)2-(Tn-1)  in which the first and the second term are 0 and 1 respectively. Help Siddhant to find up to N terms of the series.


Input:
N = 3
Output:
0 1 -1
Explanation:
First-term is given as 0 and the second 
term is 1. So the T3 = (T3-2)2 - (T3-1) 
= T12 - T2 = 02 - 1 = -1






class Solution{
    
    static void gfSeries(int N){
        long a = 0;
        long b = 1;
        
        System.out.print(a+" " + b+ " ");
        
        print((long)N-2,a,b);
         System.out.println();
        
    }
    
    static void print(long n , long a , long b){
        if(n == 0){
            return;
        }
        long c = a*a - b;
         a = b;
        b = c;
        
        System.out.print(c+" ");
        
        print(n-1,a,b);
        
    }
