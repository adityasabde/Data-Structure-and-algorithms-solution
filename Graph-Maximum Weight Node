Given a maze with N cells. Each cell may have multiple entry points but not more than one exit (i.e entry/exit points are unidirectional doors like valves).
You are given an array Edge[] of N integers, where Edge[i] contains the cell index that can be reached from cell i in one step. Edge[i] is -1 if the ith cell doesn't have an exit. 
The task is to find the cell with maximum weight (The weight of a cell is the sum of cell indexes of all cells pointing to that cell). If there are multiple cells with the maximum weight return the cell with highest index.

Note: The cells are indexed with an integer value from 0 to N-1. If there is no cell pointing to the ith cell then the weight of the i'th cell is zero.

Example 1:

Input:
N = 4
Edge[] = {2, 0, -1, 2}
Output: 2
Explanation: 
1 -> 0 -> 2 <- 3
weight of 0th cell = 1
weight of 1st cell = 0 
(because there is no cell pointing to the 1st cell)
weight of 2nd cell = 0+3 = 3
weight of 3rd cell = 0
There is only one cell which has maximum weight
(i.e 2) So, cell 2 is the output.
Example 2:

Input:
N = 1
Edge[] = {-1}
Output: 0
Explanation:
weight of 0th cell is 0.
There is only one cell so 
cell 0 has maximum weight.

           }
       }
       return index;
    }
