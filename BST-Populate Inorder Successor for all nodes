Given a Binary Tree, write a function to populate next pointer for all nodes. The next pointer for every node should be set to point to inorder successor.

Example 1:

Input:
           10
       /  \
      8    12
     /
    3
  

Output: 3->8 8->10 10->12 12->-1
Explanation: The inorder of the above tree is :
3 8 10 12. So the next pointer of node 3 is 
pointing to 8 , next pointer of 8 is pointing
to 10 and so on.And next pointer of 12 is
pointing to -1 as there is no inorder successor 
of 12.




//User function Template for Java

/*
class Node {
    int data;
    Node left, right,next;
    
    public Node(int data){
        this.data = data;
    }
}
*/
class Solution{
    Node prev = null;
    public void populateNext(Node root){
        if(root == null) return;
        
        populateNext(root.left);
        if(prev == null){
            prev = root;
        }else{
            prev.next = root;
            prev = root;
        }
        
        populateNext(root.right);
    }
}
