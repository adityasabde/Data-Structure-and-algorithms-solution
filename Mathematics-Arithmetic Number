Given three integers  'A' denoting the first term of an arithmetic sequence , 'C' denoting the common difference of an arithmetic sequence and an integer 'B'. you need to tell whether 'B' exists in the arithmetic sequence or not.

Input: A = 1, B = 3, C = 2
Output: 1
Explaination: 3 is the second term of the 
sequence starting with 1 and having a common 
difference 2.


Input: A = 1, B = 2, C = 3
Output: 0
Explaination: 2 is not present in the sequence.




class Solution{
    static int inSequence(int a, int b, int c){
       double n;

        if(c==0){

            if( a==b ){
                return 1 ;
            }else{
                return 0; 
            }    

        }
        
        n=(double)(b-a)/c + 1;

        int m = (b-a)/c + 1;

        if(n!=m || n<=0){
            return 0;
        }

        return 1;
    }
}
