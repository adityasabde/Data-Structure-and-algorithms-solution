Given the root of a binary tree, flatten the tree into a "linked list":

The "linked list" should use the same Node class where the right child pointer points to the next   node in the list and the left child pointer is always null.
The "linked list" should be in the same order as a pre-order traversal of the binary tree.


Input : 
          1
        /   \
       2     5
      / \     \
     3   4     6
Output :
1 2 3 4 5 6 
Explanation: 
After flattening, the tree looks 
like this
    1
     \
      2
       \
        3
         \
          4
           \
            5
             \
              6 
Here, left of each node points 
to NULL and right contains the 
next node in preorder.The inorder 
traversal of this flattened tree 
is 1 2 3 4 5 6.





class Solution
{
    static Node prev;
    public static void flatten(Node root)
    {
       prev = new Node(-1);
       dfs(root);
       
    }
    
    static void dfs(Node root){
        if(root == null){
            return;
        }
        
        Node leftSubtree = root.left;
        root.left = null;
        Node rightSubtree = root.right;
        root.right = null;
        
        prev.right = root;
        prev = root;
            
        
        dfs(leftSubtree);
        dfs(rightSubtree);
    }
    
}
