There is one meeting room in a firm. There are N meetings in the form of (start[i], end[i]) where start[i] is start time of meeting i and end[i] is finish time of meeting i.
What is the maximum number of meetings that can be accommodated in the meeting room when only one meeting can be held in the meeting room at a particular time?



Input:
N = 6
start[] = {1,3,0,5,8,5}
end[] =  {2,4,6,7,9,9}
Output: 
4
Explanation:
Maximum four meetings can be held with
given start and end timings.
The meetings are - (1, 2),(3, 4), (5,7) and (8,9)


class Solution 
{
    //Function to find the maximum number of meetings that can
    //be performed in a meeting room.
    static class Pair{
        int start;
        int end;
        Pair(int start , int end){
            this.start = start;
            this.end = end;
        }
    }
    
    public static int maxMeetings(int start[], int end[], int n)
    {
      ArrayList<Pair> list = new ArrayList<>();
       int i =0 ;
       while(i<n){
         list.add(new Pair(start[i],end[i]));
         i++;
       }
         int count = 1;
         int prev =0;       
         Collections.sort(list, (p1, p2) -> p1.end - p2.end);
         
          for(int j = 1;j<n;j++){
              if(list.get(j).start > list.get(prev).end){
                  count++;
                  prev = j;
              }
          } 
          
          return count;
       
    }
}
